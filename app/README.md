# hello.zero

Playing around with [zero](https://github.com/remoteinterview/zero) webserver by [codeinterview.io](https://codeinterview.io/).

```console
npm install -g zero
cd app
zero
```

or using docker-compose

```console
docker-compose build
docker-compose up app
```

Then fire up

- [localhost/time](http://localhost/times) for the time-api and
- [localhost](http://localhost) for a dead simple React-App.
